    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become more and more popular in the medical domain over the past few years.
While supervised machine learning has received the most attention, unsupervised learning has great potential since there is more data available for the training of the models.
Especially when leveraging the multi-modal nature of most clinical data can self-supervised learning provide results comparable to supervised methods.
In this article, we apply a method for self-supervised training proposed in \cite{thomas_gener-ELBO} to the MIMIC-CXR Database \cite{johnson2019mimic} and evaluate it in an exhaustive list of experiments.
