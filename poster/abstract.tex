As scientific work becomes increasingly collaborative and automated, reproducibility becomes increasingly vital for sharing and integrating scientific results.
For most researchers, however, reproducibility remains a nebulous ideal, the benefits of which are considered more theoretical and indirect, than practical and immediate.
Here we showcase an open-source reference implementation of a technology stack which makes the benefits of reproducibility accessible via a reusable document template.

The prevalent and currently most accessible medium of exchange for high-level (i.e. semantic) scientific results is that of the document.
As this medium (including e.g. posters and articles) is static, it encourages the creation of work which is unreproducible.
We present an infrastructure which addresses this issue, without compromising content sharing standards, by automatically generating variable article elements (e.g. figures and statistics) directly from code and data.
