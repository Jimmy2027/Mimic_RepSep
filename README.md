# Multimodal Generative Learning on the MIMIC-CXR Database

These are the content files used to generate scientific communication materials for the project titled “Multimodal Generative Learning on the MIMIC-CXR Database”.

## Compilation Instructions

This is a [RepSeP](https://github.com/TheChymera/RepSeP) -style document.
The data processing step is run asynchronously from the document compilation, and you may choose to reproduce either the top-level statistics (“demo” reproduction) or the entire analysis starting from the raw data (“full analysis stack” reproduction).


### Top-Level Analysis

```
cd /path/to/mimic_repsep
./compile.sh
```

### Full Analysis Stack

```
cd /path/to/mimic_repsep
./produce.sh
```

The data generated by the workflow will be stored under ``path/to/mimic_repsep/data``.
